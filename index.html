  <!-- FEATURE REQUESTS -->
  <h2><u>Planned Features</u></h2>

  <h3>General Improvements</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Header for each page is linked to a general file, so header code is not being 
      reused for every page. Will save time if new pages are added so only one resource gets 
      updated instead of going through every file
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Pvalue Generator</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Wifi option has access point configuration
    </li>
    <li>
      2140 to have visual preview of key configurations.
      Could expand to other phones with 8 key screens?
    </li>
    <li>
      Save information to SQL database
    </li>
    <li>
      During creation of device, MAC address is request information. 
      During download, MAC address is default name, but can be changed.
      </li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Queue Call Metrics</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Ability to save reports in csv file</li>
    <li>Possible database for appending weekly call information to?</li>
    <li>API interaction to pull queue call information from specific queues and total agents 
      to automatically calculate metrics and revised data
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Firmware Download Page</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>*Unlikely* implement JS that detects firmware of device connecting "ie .19 firmware* 
      and redirect request automatically to 5.45 as 5.65 doesn't work as immediate upgrade.
       0.19 to 5.45 would need to serve as step-up upgrade
    </li>
  </ul>


  <!-- END OF FEATURE REQUESTS -->
